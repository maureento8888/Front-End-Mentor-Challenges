# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This repo is a list of my solutions to [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges.

Frontend Mentor is an online platform that encourages you to solve **real-world front-end challenges** your own way, giving you a design preview to code up to, and submitting it to other users for review if you like. I love this platform and use it to improve my **front-end development skills**, utlizing **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS (ES6+)**, and **my favourite front-end framework, Vue.js** (only in exclusive projects).

As my interests are in **responsive design** and **web accessibility**, some of my solutions do _not_ look exactly like their master solution (see individual project READMEs) as per my personal opinion and style.

The default README.md for each project can be viewed in their respective repositories.

## Completed project results (My results only, I promise! üòÑ):

NOTE: I have not included mobile viewports here but a quick download of a project's html file should make it easily viewable on a browser at all viewports! I will work on including mobile viewport results (PNGs) that do not cut off halfway in a screenshot! ‚òùüèº
