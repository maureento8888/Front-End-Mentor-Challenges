# Frontend Mentor Challenges

List of my solutions to [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges.

Frontend Mentor is an online platform that encourages you to solve **real-world front-end challenges** your own way, giving you a design preview to code up to, and submitting it to other users for review if you like. I love this platform and use it to improve my **front-end development skills**, utlizing **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS (ES6+)**, and **my favourite front-end framework, Vue.js** (only in exclusive projects).

The default README.md for each project can be viewed in their respective repositories.
