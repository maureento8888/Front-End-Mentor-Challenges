# Frontend-Mentor-Challenges

This repo is a list of my solutions to [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges.

Frontend Mentor is an online platform that encourages you to solve real-world front-end challenges your own way, giving you a design preview to code up to, and submitting it to other users for review. I love this platform and use it to improve my front-end development skills, utlizing HTML5, CSS3, JS (ES6+), and my favourite front-end framework, Vue.js (only in exclusive projects).

The default README.md for generated each project can be viewed in their respective repositories.

With no further ado, here's a list of the completed projects' results (my results only! ðŸ˜„):
