## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [rel.ink](https://rel.ink) API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️: Rel.ink seems to have been experiencing some issues lately. So, if the API isn't available, here's a great alternative: [https://cleanuri.com/](https://cleanuri.com/).
